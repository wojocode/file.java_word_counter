**Overview**

- The Java Finder Program is a simple utility for searching occurrences of a specified word within a java file,
  excluding content within comments. This program can be particularly useful in parsing and analyzing source code or any
  text file where comments may contain the search string but are not intended to be part of the actual search.

**Features**

- Searches for occurrences of a specified string in a file.
  Ignores content within both single-line (//) and multi-line comments.
  Counts and returns the number of occurrences of the specified string.
